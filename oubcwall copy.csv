Had our goals meeting to get on the same page about what we want to achieve over the next month to win the Boat Race!
Made a concrete plan of how to attain full belief in the project
7 strokes boat race winning rhythm 
Productive goal setting!
Had productive conversations laying out quantified and achievable goals
Recovery booties
"prioritising recovery, sauna, hydration, good pre race dinner"
Watched racing together and weâ€™re clear on being on the same page 
Went through all the course info and race plan so we are ready for Heineken! 
Thought about doing pushes with technique / long suspension / front of my seat not power
Spent lots of time / bandwidth on steering and understand conditions on a new body of water
Worked on my 12.5% and working with everyone to move the boat
Executed race plan well! 
Beat Molsey 
Braved the headwind and raced our butts off in Amsterdam!
"Put down a time against Tideway competition (Thames, Molesey) that stacks us evenly against Cambridge"
"Made and executed a really good race plan, practiced rowing well in the headwind"
"attacked the 2.5k together as a unit, and fought our way through the headwind blue headed "
Bravery going hard off the start and holding on for the race
"everyone embracing their new roles, and working together to set time keeping and recovery standards "
